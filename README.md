# CI/CD Pipeline to Deploy Reddit Clone on AWS

A cloud-native Reddit Clone deployed using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with Kubernetes, Jenkins, ArgoCD, and AWS infrastructure.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end development, automation, and deployment of a Reddit-like web application using a modern DevOps toolchain and AWS cloud services. The application is built as a set of microservices, each containerized and orchestrated via Kubernetes (AWS EKS). The CI/CD pipeline ensures rapid, secure, and automated deployments, minimizing manual intervention and enabling continuous delivery[1].

---

## Features

- **Reddit-like Functionality:** User authentication, post creation, upvoting/downvoting, commenting, and community managementâ€”implemented as independent microservices[1].
- **Microservices Architecture:** Each feature is a separate service, allowing modularity and independent scaling[1].
- **CI/CD Automation:** End-to-end automation from code commit to deployment using Jenkins, Docker, and ArgoCD[1].
- **Code Quality & Security:** Integrated static code analysis with SonarQube to enforce high code quality and security standards[1].
- **Observability:** Real-time monitoring and dashboards using Prometheus and Grafana[1].
- **Scalability & High Availability:** Deployed on AWS EKS with Kubernetes auto-scaling and AWS-managed infrastructure[1].
- **GitOps Workflow:** Declarative, version-controlled deployments managed by ArgoCD[1].
- **Infrastructure as Code:** All infrastructure (EC2, EKS, IAM, etc.) provisioned using Terraform and Helm[1].
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Secure access management via Kubernetes RBAC and AWS IAM policies[1].

## Architecture

The architecture follows a modular, cloud-native approach:

1. **Source Code Management:** Code is hosted on GitHub. Every commit triggers the pipeline via webhooks[1].
2. **Continuous Integration:** Jenkins pulls code, runs tests, performs static code analysis (SonarQube), builds Docker images, and pushes them to AWS ECR[1].
3. **Continuous Deployment:** Helm charts define Kubernetes resources. ArgoCD syncs the latest changes from GitHub to AWS EKS, ensuring GitOps-based deployments[1].
4. **Monitoring:** Prometheus scrapes metrics from services and nodes; Grafana visualizes these metrics with real-time dashboards[1].
5. **Security:** Access to all resources is controlled via RBAC and IAM policies[1].

---

## Setup Instructions

**1. Infrastructure Provisioning**
- Use Terraform to provision an AWS EC2 instance (for Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker) and an AWS EKS cluster for Kubernetes workloads[1].
- Configure IAM roles and VPC networking as required.

**2. Jenkins & SonarQube Setup**
- Install Jenkins and SonarQube on the EC2 instance (automated via user-data scripts in Terraform)[1].
- Configure Jenkins with required plugins, credentials (AWS, GitHub), and connect to SonarQube for code analysis[1].
- Set up a Jenkins Pipeline (using a `Jenkinsfile` in your repo) with stages for checkout, SonarQube analysis, Docker build, ECR push, and ArgoCD deployment[1].

**3. Dockerization**
- Containerize each microservice using Docker. Push images to AWS ECR as part of the CI pipeline[1].

**4. Kubernetes Deployment**
- Define Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, Ingress, etc.) using Helm charts[1].
- Use ArgoCD to automate GitOps-based deployments from GitHub to AWS EKS[1].

**5. Monitoring & Observability**
- Install Prometheus and Grafana on your EKS cluster using Helm[1].
- Configure dashboards for application and infrastructure metrics[1].

**6. Security**
- Enforce access controls using Kubernetes RBAC and AWS IAM[1].
- Manage secrets using Kubernetes Secrets and IAM roles[1].

**7. Testing**
- Functional, integration, and load testing are performed automatically in the pipeline and manually using tools like Postman and k6[1].

## DevOps Pipeline Flow

1. **Code Commit:** Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. **CI Trigger:** GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins.
3. **Build & Test:** Jenkins runs tests, SonarQube analysis, and builds Docker images.
4. **Image Push:** Docker images are pushed to AWS ECR.
5. **CD Trigger:** Jenkins updates Helm charts in the GitHub repo; ArgoCD detects changes and deploys to EKS.
6. **Post-Deployment Validation:** Automated and manual tests run; monitoring is updated.
7. **Feedback:** Developers receive notifications via email and dashboards[1].
